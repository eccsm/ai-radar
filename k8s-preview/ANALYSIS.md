Key Findings:
============

âœ… Services successfully converted to Deployments and Services
âœ… ConfigMaps created for environment variables
âœ… Secrets template created with Vault annotations for dynamic injection
âœ… PersistentVolumeClaims created with proper StorageClass
âœ… Ingress created with TLS and security headers
âœ… Resource limits and requests defined for all containers
âœ… Health probes (liveness and readiness) configured
âœ… Network Policies implemented for pod isolation
âœ… RBAC with ServiceAccounts, Roles, and RoleBindings
âœ… PostgreSQL converted to StatefulSet for stable network identity
âœ… cert-manager integration for automated TLS certificate management

âš ï¸  Manual Adjustments Still Needed:
- Update Secret values with real credentials (base64 encoded)
- Verify resource requests/limits match your cluster capacity
- Confirm StorageClass names match your cluster configuration
- Update Ingress hostname and email for TLS certificates

ğŸ”§ Next Steps:
1. Review all generated manifests in k8s-preview/
2. Update secrets with real values or configure Vault integration
3. Install cert-manager if not already present: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
4. Apply manifests: kubectl apply -f k8s-preview/
5. Consider converting to Helm charts for production use

Kubernetes Readiness Score: 9/10
- All core services converted with best practices
- Persistent storage configured with proper StorageClass
- Network policies implemented for security
- RBAC configured with proper ServiceAccounts
- Resource management defined for all containers
- Health probes configured for reliability
- TLS and security headers implemented
